<p>I am a student in Thomas A Edison CTE HS. I have learned many coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, Java, JQuery. I decided to take web desgin because I saw it as a way to finally make my own websites and desgin it the way I like. I love shopping and trying new things. I enjoy watching tiktoks, kdramas, and youtube. I have good listening skills along with time mangment. I hope to become a CPA one day and masters in Accounting.</p>
